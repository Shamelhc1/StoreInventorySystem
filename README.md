# 🛒 Java Store Management System

This is a command-line Java application that simulates a basic store management system. It allows users to manage a product inventory, organize items by category, add/remove items from a shopping cart, and calculate totals at checkout. The project is written using core Java and object-oriented programming principles.

This project was developed as part of my learning path to become a professional Java software developer.
